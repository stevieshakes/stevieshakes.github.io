    <p class="text-sizing">At the time, the Borrowell website had been the main source of traffic for members gaining access and monitoring their credit profiles. Analytics tell us that users often log into the website in anticipation of a refreshed credit score alongside tailored product recommendations.</p>
    
    <p class="text-sizing"><strong>In response...</strong>
      Borrowell wanted to support the immediacy of
      information sought after by their customers.
      The Rangle team designed and built a best-in-class mobile app
      that offers push notifications for updates to both credit
      score and product recommendations, with robust
      security features, including biometric login, comparable
      to major banking apps.</p>

      We worked closely to map out a series of flows representing scalable solutions that easily integrate into the current web experience. The goal was to create a simplified and transparent experience for Borrowell's members, consisting of:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Sign up and log in</li>
      <li>Onboarding and biometrics setup for secure login</li>
      <li>Retrieval of credit score and credit report</li>
      <li>Exploration of product recommendations</li>

    <h3>The Google card paradigm</h3>
<p class="text-sizing">We knew we had to educate users on financial literacy and display a lengthy credit report meaning that the app would be pretty content heavy and would require a solution that was scalable and easy to use.</p>

<p class="text-sizing">The team worked together through a card sorting exercise to categorize different types of content examples, the frequency in which they would appear on the app, and their priority (order).</p>

<p class="text-sizing">We decided that the best way to visualize this information would be using a card component. This is mainly because they can carry several behaviours (dropdown, links, dialogs) while looking consistent. By doing so, We created 3 types of cards: Task cards, Fact cards, and Blog post cards.</p>

    <h3>Good ol' wireframes</h3>
<p class="text-sizing">After long ideation sessions and multiple flows created, we were simultaneously creating wireframes. The goal was to test out different designs quickly in order to pivot and edit the WIP as
  necessary based on actionable feedback.</p>

    <h3>Test regularly and implement feedback</h3>
<p class="text-sizing">We made sure that multiple rounds of usability testing were implemented in our process for both Lo-fi and Hi-fi work. Regular usability testing sessions were planned and conducted with Borrowell users as well as internal stakeholders.</p>

  <p class="text-sizing"><strong>Our research activities included:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Creating multiple InVision prototypes</li>
  <li>Recruiting participants</li>
  <li>Drafting test plans</li>
  <li>Conducting usability test sessions</li>
  <li>Synthesizing actionable feedback</li>
  <li>Implementing feedback into delivery cycles</li>
</ul>

<p class="text-sizing">Our usability tests were usually with 5 participants per round and were split into 2 phases.</p>

<p class="text-sizing"><strong>Phase 1: Wireframe based prototypes</strong></p>

<p class="text-sizing">Evaluate flows and functionality, layout of content, and utility (core needs). At the end of each session we had cut out product cards and asked users to sort them based on what content is most important to them. We captured the product card results in the image seen below.</p>

<p class="text-sizing"><strong>Key nuggets from usability sessions:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Reinforce confirmation screens for clarity</li>
  <li>During onboarding, align progress bar with actual number of steps</li>
  <li>Provide more tooltips for complex terminology (within credit report)</li>
  <li>Revisit naming of text links</li>

  <li>Appreciated educational aspects of credit score and credit report</li>

    <h3>Make it fashion: final app experience</h3>
<p class="text-sizing">One key takeaway from this project I found to be very rewarding was that testing at multiple stages of the experience can uncover paint points that you or your team were unable to diagnose. Even if you don't test with real users, conducting quick sessions internally with participants who have no visibility to the application will give you quick actionable feedback and allow you to validly pivot the work in progress.</p>

<p class="text-sizing">When it came to designing the Borrowell experience for both iOS and Android devices, we not only learned more about financial literacy but we were able to create a meaningful and trustworthy experience for users who are new to or experienced with the topic of credit.</p>

<p class="text-sizing"><strong>Key features included:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Biometric login (fingerprint and Face ID)</li>

You can use the Tenant Manager to monitor your storage usage and manage user accounts through a process called identity federation or by creating local groups and users to assign them specific permissions for that account (for example, a group named Admins would be given the control of administrators for the account). For S3 tenant accounts, you can also manage S3 keys, manage S3 buckets, and configure platform services but we won’t go too deep into that because it can become quite overwhelming.</p>

    <h6>The Challenge</h6>
    <h3>Redesigning the Experience</h3>
<p class="text-sizing">The original experience was outdated, content heavy, and inefficient to users. Our goals for the project were to: understand the needed capabilities of Tenant Manager, enhance the current experience, leverage NetApp’s newly built LUCI design system, create documentation (flows, accessbility requirements), work with developers to build out a POC and do our best to educate the client about the necessity of UX and Visual Design.</p>

      <h6>The Discovery</h6>
      <h3>Early insights from users</h3>
  <p class="text-sizing">The discovery phase was a quick, high‐intensity effort that allowed us to define project milestones, audit the existing work, review the competitor landscape, and begin research into user needs, behaviours and pain‐points.</p>
  <p class="text-sizing">We conducted adaptive user interviews with 5 participants to understand why and how Tenant Manager is used in order to improve it. The interview flow and questions were adjusted according to the users’ context.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="project-sm project-md project-lg">
    <h3>We formed questions covering:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>User profile and team makeup</li>
      <li>Perceived value of Tenant Manager</li>
      <li>Current pain points</li>
      </ul>
</div>
<div class="project-sm project-md project-lg">
  <h3>Value - Top 3 findings</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Tenant Manager is highly valued as an end-user enabler</li>
    <li>Tenant Manager is under utilized; this can be attributed to missing features (need for 3rd party tools)</li>
    <li>General consensus was that the Tenant Manager is easy to use; however, it needs additional features, a  modernized look & feel, and more efficient and interactive experience</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="project-sm project-md project-lg">
  <h3>Usability - Top 3 findings</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Mental effort required to complete tasks is higher than ideal</li>
    <li>Organization of table list items can be improved</li>
    <li>Tooltip consistency and extent of copy throughout the UI can be improved</li>
    </ul>
</div>
    

    <div class="project-sm project-md project-lg">
      <h3>For consideration</h3>
  <p class="text-sizing">The end-users’ primary role is grid manager (another branch of NetApp’s product, but connected to Tenant Manager). They occasionally manage a tenant’s account on behalf of a tenant.</p>
  <p class="text-sizing">We gathered useful insights into the users’ team makeup, roles and responsibilities, workflows, current and future use cases, and secondary contextual information about tenants and their use-cases. However, we did not get the usability insights as the users are not primarily using Tenant Manager and we did not have access to primary users of Tenant Manager.</p>
  <p class="text-sizing">To complement this study, a heuristic evaluation was done (which will be reviewed later in this case study) to reveal gaps in the current state of the UI that can be improved upon future iterations.</p>

<div class="project-sm project-md project-lg">
  <h3>Team profiles and workflow</h3>
<p class="text-sizing">After stakeholder interviewers were completed, we created four different team profiles to understand how Tenant Manager is being used and to guide design decisions, priorities, and create empathy amongst the client and our team throughout the project.</p>
</div>

  <h3>Creating the scenarios</h3>
<p class="text-sizing">We worked with the client and gathered our feedback from users to map out different scenarios and identify the current usage of the selected scenario, any pains involved to reach the final result, and any wants the users would like to see built into the Tenant Manager.</p>
<p class="text-sizing">The images below represent the different focus areas in Tenant Manager and each coloured sticky note represents a different user. We used Miro to document the results:</p>

    <h6>The Approach</h6>
    <h3>Into the trenches</h3>
<p class="text-sizing">My first step was to perform a heuristic evaluation of the entire UI to reveal usability issues. I decided to do this because I did not have access to primary users of Tenant Manager and needed to perform a method of gathering usability feedback at a lower cost for the client.</p>
<p class="text-sizing">Heuristic evaluations are performed by a UX researcher to determine a system’s overall usability. It is based on a set of proven and tested guidelines (heuristics) indicative of user interface effectiveness. It eliminates UX researcher bias and can provide detailed and concrete findings that could be implemented in a future design.</p>
<p class="text-sizing">The heuristic model being referenced is Bastien & Scapin Ergonomic Criteria for the Evaluation of Human-Computer Interfaces (which was referred to me by a colleague who had successfully completed a evaluation not too long ago) alongside the Neilsen Norman Group 10 usability heuristics.</p>

      <h3>Identifying which heuristics revealed the most issues</h3>
     <p class="text-sizing">My findings revealed that there was a pretty even spread between efficiency, workload, consistency, and guidance as the main contributors affecting the experience.</p>
     <p class="text-sizing">I found that the UI lacked the ability for efficiency, meaning that accelerators are not as available to speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users.</p>
     <p class="text-sizing"> It was also determined that user tasks were overwhelming and exhausting which can contribute to cognitive load for users. The UI also lacked clear and sufficient guidance to help users from creating and recovering from errors (tooltip, helper text, form field requirements).</p>

          <h3>Aligning ourselves with the Design System</h3>
      <p class="text-sizing">In order to define the overall structure of the experience we needed to understand the LUCI Design System as a whole. We were in constant communication with the makers of this Design System to provide us with a foundation in order to design and build a cohesive NetApp digital product and to understand design decisions that were made.</p>

        <h3>On track and <del>NSYNC</del> in sync</h3>
    <p class="text-sizing">After understanding different use cases for Tenant Manager and aligning with the LUCI team, we felt we were in the right place to start mapping out the the new structure. I began to think about particular usage contexts, the opportunities they present and how elements in the interface would help to support the user. We held multiple whiteboarding sessions to help us communicate complex flows and visualize the experience. This ultimately led to a finalized flow and was quickly approved by the client.</p>

      <h3>Creating the experience</h3>
  <p class="text-sizing">Due to the scale of this product we had to move quickly and efficiently. I began to build out wireframes while staying in communication with the client to make iterations seamless and leave no surprises. At the same time, I was protyping screens into InVision and testing screens internally to gauge usability and put my mind to ease that I was on the right track. Quick and dirty usability tests are better than no testing at all.</p>

<p class="text-sizing">Since the POC build, stakeholders have responded well to the new features and the simplistic redesign. The team effectively worked together to evolve their design process and communicate the importance of building products with a UX mindset; so much so the client has brought on a internal Experience Designer to maintain the product.</p>

    <h3>What I learned</h3>
<p class="text-sizing">There’s always time for testing. Due to time constraints, we agreed to do quick tests internally with Developers and DevOps because after all, your customers won’t forgive you.</p>
<p class="text-sizing">Collaboration from the very beginning was essential. During the beginning phase of the project, both VD and UX worked closely together. After explaining our process to the client and demonstrating what we could do in a week together in comparison to their waterfall method, it not only built trust between my team and our client but also expedited our process.</p>

          <h3>Project overview</h3>
            <p class="text-sizing">An increase in using short-term psychotherapies combined with opportunities driven by technological advancements has led to the popularity of smartphone applications designed for mental health support especially among youth. This community-based project is a collaboration between my team, youth in the Region of Peel, the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), the Peel Service Collaborative (PSC) and CoDesign. It involves the creation of a digital platform that draws from existing community services and aids youth in anticipating and dealing with crisis (a state in which a person is unable to cope). This three-year initiative has resulted in Mellow, a mobile application for youth.</p>
            <p class="text-sizing">This project has allowed me to collaborate closely with real users (youth) and developers, I was able to design, and create wireframes, journey maps, app flows, InVision prototypes, and concept videos as well as conduct interviews, in-person surveying, and usability testing.</p>
            <p class="text-sizing">In April 2018, my team and I placed as finalists in the CHI 2018 competition in Montreal and were able to present and showcase the work we have developed using a collaborative design approach.</p>

              <p class="text-sizing">The Youth stressed to us that keeping their information secure and private was something that would enable them to use the application.</p>
              <h4>Culturally Inclusive Design</h4>  
              <p class="text-sizing">Youth experience crisis differently and it can be an isolating experience when cultural and language barriers are presented to them.</p>
              <h4>Crisis Planning and Management</h4>

              <h3>What I learned</h3> 
              <p class="text-sizing">Empathy played a big role in creating copy for the application as we had to be cognisant of words  that could be triggering towards youth and elicit a negative response. We had to request constant and additional feedback from counsellors in terms of how best to write a crisis plan and copy within the application.</p>
              <p class="text-sizing">Building trust was a difficult processs. The youth were both hesitant and passionate and wanted to be sure that we were serious about this matter. We worked together to make everyone feel comfortable and encourage participation to make everyone feel welcome and involed.</p>
              <p class="text-sizing">It was inspiring to see the youth so empowered and voicing their opinions in each phase of the process. I truly value their advocacy for mental health awareness and made me more aware to incorporate these kinds of design decisions into my process.</p>

          <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p class="text-sizing">This redesign is a concept made after I had conducted a usability test of the Volkswagen website. The design is a combination of a simplified tool and a fun user experience that allows users to seamlessly build a vehicle of their choice.</p>

    <p class="text-sizing">The idea was to incorporate the consistency with Volkswagen's branding in this redesign. I wanted to include the circular style of their logo and make it exciting and interactive. Furthermore, since the logo on the trunk of their cars integrates a "push to open" style of interactivity, I thought this was an interesting concept to base my design off of.</p>

          <h3>Wireframes</h3>
    <p class="text-sizing">Several wireframes were made using Adobe XD to plan out the structure of the design. The pages were very similar so I have included only one sample below.</p>

          <h3>Functionality</h3>
    <p class="text-sizing">All the elements needed to configure the vehicle is based inside the wheel. Users can drag the blue circle or click each selection to choose their preference. All details and information will show up on the inner circles and users can start over by clicking the arrow at the bottom of the circle to go back once or click the top to of the circle to be taken back to the "models" page.</p>
